# How to customize the leading and trailing dates of the month cells in the Flutter Calendar?

A quick-start example to help you to customize the leading and trailing dates of the month cells in the Flutter Calendar.

You can customise the leading and trailing dates in the Flutter Event Calendar by using the [monthCellBuilder](https://help.syncfusion.com/flutter/calendar/builders#month-cell-builder) property of the Flutter event calendar.

Using MonthCellDetails from the moncellbuilder, you can determine whether the date is leading or trailing. Month dates in the Flutter calendar are customised based on those details.
